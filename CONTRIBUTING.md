# Contributing

## Commits
This project follows the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) pattern, specifically the [angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

To help you with this, make sure you run `npm install` after you checkout the repo. It will fail if your commit message does not comply to the standard.

You can also commit by doing `git add` and then `npm run commit` to get a CLI interface to specify the different parts to the commit.
